```{r set-up}
library(tidyverse)

athletes <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdpapworth/Athletics/master/data/athletes.txt",
                         col_types = cols(dob = col_date(format = "%Y%m%d")))

```

## Is there a Relative Age Effect

The results are for top ranked athletes nationally. Since age-groups are based on a September cut-off, there seems to be a selection bias.

```{r month_of_birth}
library(lubridate)

athletes %>%
  mutate(mob = month(dob, label = T)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mob)) +
  geom_bar()
```
